# puppet-lint-exec_idempotent-check

A puppet-lint plugin to check "exec" resources to ensure they have been written in an idempotent manner. Basically, ensure they used "onlyif", "unless", or "refreshonly".

## Installing
### From the command line
```shell
$ gem install puppet-lint-exec_idempotent-check
```

### In a Gemfile
```ruby
gem 'puppet-lint-exec_idempotent-check'
```

## Checks
### Validates that an exec resource is idempotent

For an exec resource to pass it must be using at least one parameter that ensures idepotence. The value of the parameters is not checked. The parameters being looked for are
"onlyif", "unless", and "refreshonly" as they are considered to this check to ensure idempotance. This check is of course opinionated, so to that end, the "creates" parameter is
not accepted. This check does not view that parameter as a good practice.

#### Disabling the check
To disable this check, you can add `--no-exec_idempotent-check` to your puppet-lint command line.

```shell
$ puppet-lint --no-exec_idempotent-check path/to/file.pp
```

Alternatively, if youâ€™re calling puppet-lint via the Rake task, you should insert the following line to your `Rakefile`.

```ruby
PuppetLint.configuration.send('disable_exec_idempotent')
```

## Fix support
This check provides none! Fix your stuff :)
